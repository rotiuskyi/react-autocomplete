### Proposals for improvements:
- implement different searching strategies (startsWith, contains, case sensitive/insensitive)
- implement infinite scroll/pagination feature for the dropping autocomplete menu
- implement dropping direction for the autocomplete options
- enhance Autocomplete components with multiselection, visual customization, key and mouse event navigation, etc
